		<p><strong>Question</strong>: How can find pairs of numbers in a list (assume no duplicates) that sum to a value of 10 and display them in O(n) time using a set data structure?</p>
        
		<p><strong>Answer</strong>: We could do two embedded for loops looking for pairs but this would be O(n^2).  A set gives us O(1) for lookup.  If we knew the value we were looking for and if those values were put in a set, then we could get O(1).  We could add all of the numbers into a set.  Then we could loop through the original list again (call each number x) and then lookup quickly in the set for 10-x.  However, we might get duplicate answers (such as 3+7 and 7+3)</p>
        
        <p>We could avoid the duplication and the two sequential loops.  Suppose my list was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].  While building the set from the list, I could actively check to see if 10-x is in my set yet.  If I was currently looking at the '2', then 10-2 (or 8) would not be in the set yet.  However, eventually we will get to the '8' and then '2' will be in set by that time. This is O(n).</p>
