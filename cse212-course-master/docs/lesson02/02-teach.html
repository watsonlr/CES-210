      <h1>W02 Teach: Group Practice</h1>
		
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
		
	  <p>These problems should be completed and discussed as a group.  Answers are provided below.</p>
		
	  <h3>Problem 1 - Analyze Code</h3>
		  <p>In this section, you will be asked several questions related to performance using big O notation.  You will be asked to compare your answers to the actual solutions at the end of this section.  You should watch the clock to make sure you don't spend more than half of your hour on this section before going to the next section.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><p>Open up the following code and determine the big O notation for each of the four functions: <a href="02-teach_four_functions.py" target="_blank">02-teach_four_functions.py</a></p></li>
			<li><p>To calculate the average of a list of numbers, we can use the built-in Python functions as follows: <code>average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)</code>.  What is the big O notation for this code.  You will need to think about how the built-in Python functions are implemented.</p></li>
			<li><p>Using either a graphing calculator or a graphing website (e.g. <a href="http://desmos.com/calculator" target="_blank">desmos.com</a>), plot the following graphs:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>y = x^2 to represent O(n^2)</li>
					<li>y = log(x) to represent O(log n)</li>
					<li>y = x to represent O(n)</li></ul>
				<p>Using the graph, put the big O notations in order (best performance first and worst performance last) for when <code>n</code> is large.</p>
			</li>
		  	<li><p>When you are done, take a look at the <a href="02-teach_analyze-solution.html" target="_blank">solution</a> and discuss it together.  </p></li>
		</ol>

	  <h3>Problem 2 - Predict, Measure, and Compare Code</h3>	
        
		<ol>
		<li><p>Download the following code and load into your code editor: <a href="02-teach_algorithms.py" target="_blank">02-teach_algorithms.py</a> (NOTE: Do not run the code until you're asked to below)</p></li>
		<li><p>This file contains three different functions called <code>algorithm1</code>, <code>algorithm2</code>, and <code>algorithm3</code>.  Predict the performance of each function using big O notation.</p></li>
			<li><p>Run the code and observe the outputs.  Here is what the columns in the table represent:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><p><code>n</code> - The size of the data given to the functions in this test</p></li>
			<li><p><code>alg1_count</code> - The number of loop iterations (i.e. work) done by <code>algorithm1</code></p></li>
			<li><p><code>alg2_count</code> - The number of loop iterations (i.e. work) done by <code>algorithm2</code></p></li>
			<li><p><code>alg3_count</code> - The number of loop iterations (i.e. work) done by <code>algorithm3</code></p></li>
			<li><p><code>alg1_time</code> - The time in milliseconds it took to complete <code>algorithm1</code></p></li>
			<li><p><code>alg2_time</code> - The time in milliseconds it took to complete <code>algorithm2</code></p></li>
			<li><p><code>alg3_time</code> - The time in milliseconds it took to complete <code>algorithm3</code></p></li>
				
			</ul>
			<p>While the <code>alg#_count</code> value should be the same in every execution, the <code>alg#_time</code> will vary every time it is executed on the same or different computers. For the timing numbers, the code ran the test 10 times and took the average.  This was done since there are some operating system conditions that could affect timing in some cases.</p></li>
		<li><p>Discuss the following together:</p></li>
			<ul>
			<li><p>Do the actual results agree with the big O predictions made earlier?  If not, what do you think the big O should be?</p></li>
			<li><p>Which function (<code>algorithm1</code>, <code>algorithm2</code>, <code>algorithm3</code>) has the best performance and which one the worst performance?</p></li>		
			<li><p>Looking at the results, why do we say that big O only applies when <code>n</code> is &quot;large&quot;?</p></li>
			</ul>
		<li><p>When you are done, take a look at the <a href="02-teach_algorithms-solution.html" target="_blank">solution</a> and discuss it together.</p></li>
		</ol>
