      <h1>W01 Teach - Problem 2 Approach</h1>
        
		<p>To solve the List Selector problem, we will need to do the following as we loop through the selector list:</p>
        
		<ul>
			<li><p>If the current value in the selector list is a 1, then we want to get the next item from the first list</p></li>
			<li><p>If the current value in the selector list is a 2, then we want to get the next item from the second list</p></li>	
			<li><p>We need to append the value we just selected to the new list </p></li>
		</ul>
        
		<p>We will need a way to determine what the next item is in either list 1 or list 2.  We will need variables to keep track of where we are (i.e. the index) in both lists:</p>
        
		<ul>
			<li><p><code>pos_list1</code> - We will use this to keep track of the index of the next item in the first list</p></li>
			<li><p><code>pos_list2</code> - We will use this to keep track of the index of the next item in the second list</p></li>
		</ul>
        
		<p>We will initialize both of these variables to 0.  When we select an item from one of the lists (per the selector list) we will add one to either <code>pos_list1</code> or <code>pos_list2</code> depending on which one was selected.</p>

		<img src="merge_lists_plan.jpeg" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Shows list1, list2, and a selector_list as described in the example from W01-Teach. Arrows are drawn from the selector_list to either list1 or list2 depending on the value in the selector_list (1 goes to list1 and 2 goes to list2).  A table is shown for each loop through the selector list (0 to 7) and the values of pos_list1 (0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3) and pos_list2 (0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3) as we go through the list.  The building of the result_list based on the pos_list1 and pos_list2 is shown as: [1], [1,2], [1,2,10], [1,2,10,20], [1,2,10,20,3], [1,2,10,20,3,4], [1,2,10,20,3,4,30], [1,2,10,20,3,4,30,40]."/>
