      <h1>W01 Teach: Group Practice</h1>
		
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
		
	  <p>These problems should be completed and discussed as a group.  Answers are provided below.</p>
		
	  <h3>Problem 1 - List Comprehension</h3>
        
		<ol>
			<li><p>To ensure you have enough time for this activity, spend no more than 15 minutes implementing this function before looking at the solution to discuss.</p></li>
			<li><p>Open up the following code: <a href="01-teach_divisors.py" target="_blank">01-teach_divisors.py</a></p></li>
			<li><p>Implement the <code>find_divisors_1</code> function.  The function should create and return a list of divisors of the number provided into the function.  The list should include the value 1 but should not include the actual number.  If the number was 12, then the resulting list would be [1, 2, 3, 4, 6].  If the number was 17, then the resulting list would be just [1] because 17 is a prime number.  When implementing the first function, use a for loop, an if statement, and call append.</p></li>
			<li><p>Re-implement the function using only a list comprehension in <code>find_divisors_2</code></p></li>
			<li><p>Compare your answer with the <a href="01-teach_divisors-solution.py" target="_blank">solution</a> and discuss together. </p></li>
		</ol>
        
	  <h3>Problem 2 - Solving a Complicated Problem</h3>
        
		<ol>
			<li><p>Open up the following code: <a href="01-teach_list_selector.py" target="_blank">01-teach_list_selector.py</a></p></li>		
			<li><p>Come up with a plan (up to 10 minutes) on how to implement the <code>list_selector</code> function.  The function takes two lists and a selector list.  The two lists are combined together into a new list according to the selector list.  The selector list only contains 1's and 2's.  A value of 1 means that you should select the next number from the first list.  A value of 2 means that you should select the next number from the second list.  For example, if list 1 is [1, 2, 3, 4] and if list 2 is [10, 20, 30, 40] and if the selector list is [1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2], then the resulting list would be [1, 2, 10, 20, 3, 4, 30, 40].</p></li>
			<li><p>Compare your plan with the following plan and discuss together: <a href="01-teach_list_selector-approach.html" target="=_blank">01-teach_list_selector-approach.html</a></p></li>
			<li><p>Implement the <code>list_selector</code> function.</p></li>
			<li><p>Compare your answer with the <a href="01-teach_list_selector-solution.py">solution</a> and discuss together. </p></li>
