        <h1>06 Prove: Individual Assignment</h1>

		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>This assignment <strong>must be completed individually</strong> to ensure you are meeting all course outcomes.  With the exception of the W06-Teach activity, you should not complete this assignment within a group.  If you obtain help from a tutor, the tutor should help you understand principles but should not help you answer these problems.  It is an honor code violation to obtain answers for these problems from others including using the internet (i.e. sites that allow students to share their solutions).</p>
		
		<p>As you solve the problems, remember to use the principles learned in the first five lessons of the course:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><p>Problem Solving Strategy: understand the problem, plan and design the solution, implement the solution, and evaluate the solution.</p></li>
		<li><p>Evaluate Performance of Alternative Solutions: use big O to determine the best solution.</p></li>
		<li><p>Understanding Code Using Reviews: analyze any code you have been given.</p></li>
		<li><p>Finding Defects Using Tests: write tests to determine if your solution is working.</p></li>
		<li><p>Articulating Answers for Technical Questions: imagine that you were asked one of these questions during an interview.  Remember to ensure that you fully understand the problem and work through different scenarios manually.  Consider how the data structure you are using will help you solve the problem.  A notebook or a whiteboard can be very useful in this process.</p></li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Download <a href="06-prove_maps.py" target="_blank">06-prove_maps.py</a> to provide all your code solutions for the problems below.</p>


		<h3>Problem 1 - Translator Class</h3>
		<p>Implement the <code>add_word</code> and <code>translate</code> functions in the Translator class using a Python dictionary.  The <code>add_word</code> function should allow the user to add word translations (e.g. english to german).  The <code>translate</code> function should return the translation of a word.  If the translation is not available for a word, then "???" should be returned instead.  You will need to call <code>add_word</code> multiple times to build a translation dictionary for testing.  You should assume that there is only one translation for every word (and vice versa).</p>
		
		<h3>Problem 2 - Degree Summary</h3>
		<p>Finish implementing the <code>summarize_degrees</code> function which reads a file and creates a Python dictionary containing a summary of all the degrees (education) that people earned as reported in the file.  The degree can be found in column 4 of the file.  Your code should automatically determine the degree names.  You should use the following file for testing: <a href="census.txt" target="_blank">census.txt</a>.</p>
			
		<h3>Problem 3 - Anagrams</h3>
		<p>Finish implementing the <code>is_anagram</code> function to determine if two words are anagrams.  Two words are an anagram if they use the same letters and the same number of letters.  For example, "CAT" and "ACT" are anagrams but "DOG" and "GOOD" are not because "GOOD" has two O's.  You must use a Python dictionary to solve this problem.  It is important to note the following assumptions:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>When determining if two words are anagrams, you should ignore any spaces.</p></li>
        <li><p>You should ignore cases.  For example, 'Ab' and 'bA' should be considered anagrams.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Reminder: You can access a letter by index in a Python string by using the [] notation.</p>
				
		<h3>Problem 4 - Maze</h3>
		<p>Implement the <code>move_left</code>, <code>move_right</code>, <code>move_up</code>, and <code>move_down</code> functions in the Maze class.  The code provides a sample Maze in the form of a dictionary where the key represents the (x,y) coordinate in the maze and the value contains the valid movements in the format (left, right, up, down).  The valid movements are set to True and False.  To test your code, will have to manually move around the maze using the dictionary maze shown in the code.  The dictionary maze can be represented graphically as follows (note that it is assumed there is a wall going around the entire maze which means that you cannot leave the outside boundaries of the maze):</p>
		<img src="maze.jpeg" alt="A maze that has 6 rows (y=1 to y=6) and 6 columns (x=1 to x=6).  Walls are drawn in the following blocks: (3,1) (3,2) (4,2) (6,2) (1,3) (3,3) (6,4) (2,5) (4,5) (6,5) (2,6) (4,6).">
		
		<h3>Problem 5 - Earthquake JSON Data</h3>
		<p>Finish implementing the <code>earthquake_daily_summary</code> function to display all the earthquake locations ('place' attribute) and magnitudes ('mag' attribute) for the current day from the United States Geological Service (USGS) website.  The <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php" target="_blank">USGS Website</a> provides details about how to interpret the data that you will receive from their server.  The data uses JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format.  In Python, JSON data is represented as a dictionary. The code uses the 'requests' library to read data from the server.  To use this library, you will need to install the 'requests' package.  To install the package, run <code>pip install requests</code> within a terminal.</p>
		
		<h2>Submission</h2>
		<p>You need to submit the following files for this assignment:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p><code>06-prove_maps.py</code> - Your solution for all problems with useful comments added to the code.</p></li>
		</ul>
