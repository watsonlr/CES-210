      <h1>W06 Teach: Group Collaboration</h1>
		
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
		
	  <p>As a group, spend one hour collaborating together on the W06-Prove problems. <strong>You must not share your actual code solutions with each other</strong>.  During this time together, you should share strategy, technique, and examples to help each other learn the material.  The use of real whiteboard or a digital whiteboard can be helpful during the discussion.  Make sure that each person in your group has an opportunity to share ideas and ask questions.  Spend no more than 10 minutes on each problem so that you have enough time to discuss all problems during the hour.  You should prepare yourself for this activity by starting and completing several of the problems from the individual assignment.</p>
