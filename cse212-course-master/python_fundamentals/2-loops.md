# Loops

When we think about computers, many will think about their vast computing power that allows for billions of operations to be completed in a single second.  However, even though the computer can do billions of operations, it does not mean that the software programmer needs to write billions of lines.  When we write code, we should think about loops that repeat code dozens or millions of times to achieve the desired result.  Consider that favorite game again and where loops might exist:

- Draw a collection of enemy ships on the screen (which in higher levels might be many)
- Compare all the bullets and enemy ships to see if you hit one of them (or if they hit you)
- Displaying all the items you have picked along your journey through the galaxy so that you can select one to use to save the world

Loops are used in two ways in Python.  The `for` loop is used when you know how many times you want to do something or you know how many things are in something.  The `while` loop is used when you don't how many times you to do something.  Selecting the correct type of loop will help you simplify your code.

## For Loops (Iterators)

The `for` loop is frequently also called an iterator because it will iterate (i.e. visit) each item in a collection.  The most basic and common collection in Python is the list.  If we had a list of numbers that we wanted to print, we could you use a `for` loop:

```python
numbers = [5, 1, 3, 2, 7]
for number in numbers:
    print(number)
```

The basic format of the loop can be written as `for item in collection:`.  The `collection` in our example above is the list `numbers`.  The `item` variable only exists inside the `for` loop block.  The block of code will run multiple times with the `number` variable being set to the each value within the `numbers` list.  In the example, the list has 5 numbers in it.  That means the the loop will run 5 times.  The first time it runs, `number` will be equal to 5 and so the number 5 will be displayed.  The second time the loop runs, the `number` will be equal to 1 and so the number 1 will be displayed next.  This will continue until the loop visits all values in the list.

Loops can be used to perform calculations.  Suppose we wanted to add all the numbers in the list together (which by the way can be done without a loop using the python `sum` function, but we want to learn about loops right now):

```python
numbers = [5, 1, 3, 2, 7]
sum_numbers = 0
for number in numbers:
    sum_numbers += number
print(sum_numbers)
```

The `+=` operator being used to add up all the numbers will run 5 times for each of the 5 numbers in the list.

Lists are not the only thing we can loop (or iterate) through:

```python
# Loop through each letter in a string
word = "watermelon"
for letter in word:
    print(letter)
    
# Loop through each line in a file
file = open("book.txt")
for line in file:
	print(line)
```

To get out of a loop, we can use the `break` statement.  The `break` statement will exit the current loop.

```python
# Determine if 'A' is in a word
word = "watermelon"
for letter in word:
    if letter == "A":
        print("Found it!")
        break 
```

## Using Range with For Loops

Sometimes we want to repeat something a certain number of times.  In this case, we don't have a collection  to loop through.  In Python, we can use the `range` function to create a "list" of numbers.  The `range` does not really give you a list, but its like a list in that you can loop through it with a `for` loop.  This can be very useful if we want to build a loop to repeat something.  For example, if we wanted to print out "Hello" 100 times, we could write the following:

```python
for x in range(100):
    print("Hello")
```

In this code, the `range(100)` will create a list of numbers from 0 to 99.  If we loop through that list, it will run 100 times.  The result is "Hello" printed 100 times.  Notice that the variable `x` is not being used in the loop block.  This is common when all we wanted to do was to repeat the code in the block.

## While Loops

The `while` loop also repeats a block of code but the number of times the loop will run is usually not known.  The `while` loop includes a boolean condition to determine if the loop should continue running.

```python
choice = None
while choice != "quit":
    choice = input("Enter a command: ")
    
    # Do something based on the value of choice
```

Notice that this loop will continue to run so long as the user does not type "quit" for the command.  This loop might run only 1 time if the user types "quit" for their first command or the loop might run forever if the user never types "quit".  It's also possible for a while loop to not run at all.  Imagine if choice was already equal to "quit" before we got to the while loop.  If this was the case, then we would not enter the while loop.  It's important to think about how we will allow entry to the `while` loop.  In this case, we choose to set `choice` equal to `None` (which is a safe value).  Since `None` does not equal "quit", we know that we will run the while loop at least one time. 

## Example: Random Number Guessing Game

When we design loops, it can be useful to draw a flow chart of how we want our program to run.  Designing software before writing code is a wise first step.  A flow chart is a simple design technique where rectangle boxes are used to represents actions and diamonds are used to represent decisions.  Arrows are drawn to represent the flow between boxes and diamonds.  The following flow chart represents a random number guessing game. 

![guess_design](guess_design.jpeg)

In the flow chart, notice that the arrows are forming cycles or loops.  This is an indication that loops should be added to your code.  The design may lead you to write the code a very specific way.  Its also possible that you can simplify your code by reconsidering and redrawing your flow chart.  For the chart above, we have a `while` loop within a `while` loop.  The outer `while` loop (the red line in the flow chart) is used to allow the user to play a new game again.  The inner `while` loop (the blue line in the flow chart) is used to allow the user to continue guessing the number until they get it right.  The boolean conditions for those while loops can be determined by looking at the chart.  The red loop continues so long as the user says "YES" to the play again prompt.  The blue loop continues so long as the guess does not match.  Compare the code below with the design above.

```python
import random

print("Welcome")
play_again = "YES"  # This will allow us into the loop the first time
while play_again == "YES":
    rand_num = random.randint(1,100)
    num_guesses = 0
    guess = -1 # This will allow us into the loop the first time
    while guess != rand_num:
        guess = int(input("Enter a guess: "))
        num_guesses += 1
        if guess < rand_num:
            print("Higher!")
        elif guess > rand_num:
            print("Lower!")
    print("Congrats!")
    print("It took {} guesses.".format(num_guesses))
    play_again = input("Play again? ")
print("Goodbye")
```

## Problem to Solve : Geometric Series Sum

Write a program that will allow the user to estimate the sum of geometric series.  A geometric series one where each element in the series is calculated by multiplying the previous value by a constant.  For example, here is a geometric series:
$$
1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{16}, \frac{1}{32}
$$
The series begins at 1 (called the initial term) and each number is determined by multiplying the previous number by 0.5 (called the series).  You should use a loop to add all of the numbers in the series.  You will have to ask the user for three things:

- What is the initial term in the series
- What is the ratio to use to calculate each number in the series
- How many terms in the series to calculate and add together (not including the initial term)

After displaying the answer, you should allow the user to calculate another sum instead of exiting the program.  You can ignore cases where the user types in invalid values (e.g. ratio of 0, number of terms in the series <= 0, etc).

The example execution show how a ratio of 0.5 converges the sum towards 2 and how a ratio of 2 does not converge but instead goes towards infinity.

```
Initial Term: 1
Ratio: 0.5
Terms to add: 5
Sum = 1.96875000000000000000

Again (Y/N)? Y
Initial Term: 1
Ratio: 0.5
Terms to add: 20
Sum = 1.99999904632568359375

Again (Y/N)? Y
Initial Term: 1
Ratio: 0.5
Terms to add: 50
Sum = 1.99999999999999911182

Again (Y/N)? Y
Initial Term: 1
Ratio: 2
Terms to add: 5
Sum = 63.00000000000000000000

Again (Y/N)? Y
Initial Term: 1
Ratio: 2
Terms to add: 20
Sum = 2097151.00000000000000000000

Again (Y/N)? Y
Initial Term: 1
Ratio: 2
Terms to add: 50
Sum = 2251799813685247.00000000000000000000

Again (Y/N)? N
```
