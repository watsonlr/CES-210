# Python Fundamentals Tutorial

Welcome to the Python Fundamentals Tutorial.  Every beginning Python programmer should understand these basic topics:

- [Conditionals](1-conditionals.md)
- [Loops](2-loops.md)
- [Functions](3-functions.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples.  At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own.  You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
